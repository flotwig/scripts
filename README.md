This is my personal script collection.

- .\Fix-Path.ps1 - This script reads the existing Windows PATH variable and reconciles the many inconsistencies which
arise from all the factors that mess with the PATH.

- .\Export-PuTTY.ps1 - One-liner to export PuTTY settings from the registry to OneDrive.

- .\Import-PuTTY.ps1 - One-liner to import PuTTY settings from OneDrive to the registry.
